  Scale up or down your OVH MKS nodepool.
  Rely on the OVH API through the [OVH NodeJS SDK](https://github.com/ovh/node-ovh) to manage your Kubernetes clusters.
  It allows you to scale the number of nodes in a specific nodepool of an OVH Managed Kubernetes Service (MKS) cluster.
  This action supports both Application Key/Application Secret and OAuth2 authentication methods.
